# GitHub Actions Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chrome Driver Initialization Error
**Problem**: Selenium couldn't maintain a Chrome session in the CI environment.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Updated Chrome options to use `--headless=new` for Chrome 112+
- Added comprehensive Chrome arguments for CI environment
- Added better error handling and debugging
- Improved Chrome binary detection
- Added Xvfb verification before running Chrome
- Used official `browser-actions/setup-chrome` action

### 2. Git Push Permission Denied
**Problem**: Workflow couldn't push changes due to authentication issues.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added `permissions: contents: write` to workflow
- Separated commit and push steps
- Used `ad-m/github-push-action` for authenticated pushing
- Updated to latest GitHub Actions versions

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/auto_scrape.yaml`
- Added `permissions: contents: write`
- Updated to `actions/checkout@v4`
- Used `browser-actions/setup-chrome@latest`
- Improved Xvfb setup with verification
- Added Chrome version verification
- Separated commit and push steps
- Used `ad-m/github-push-action@master` for pushing

### 2. `scrape_floorsheet.py`
- Updated to `--headless=new` for Chrome 112+
- Added comprehensive Chrome options for CI
- Improved Chrome binary detection
- Added better error handling and debugging
- Added test page loading to verify Chrome functionality
- Enhanced environment detection

### 3. `test_chrome_setup.py` (New)
- Created test script to verify Chrome setup
- Can be used to test locally before deployment

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Chrome Compatibility**: Using new headless mode and comprehensive options
2. **Robust Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and debugging
3. **Proper Authentication**: Using GitHub Actions token for pushing
4. **Environment Detection**: Better detection of CI environment
5. **Verification Steps**: Added checks for Xvfb and Chrome availability

## Testing

To test the changes locally:
```bash
python test_chrome_setup.py
```

The workflow should now successfully:
1. Set up Chrome in headless mode
2. Run the scraper without session errors
3. Commit and push changes with proper authentication

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Check that data is being scraped and committed successfully
4. Verify the API can access the new data files
