# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ChromeDriver 404 Error (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: The workflow was failing with a 404 error when trying to download ChromeDriver due to version mismatches.

**Solution**: Replaced manual Chrome/ChromeDriver installation with official GitHub Actions:
- `browser-actions/setup-chrome@v1` for Chrome
- `nanasess/setup-chromedriver@v2` for ChromeDriver

These actions automatically handle version compatibility.

### 2. Workflow Configuration Updates
**Changes Made**:
- Added proper permissions (`contents: write`, `actions: read`)
- Added virtual display setup with Xvfb
- Added Chrome setup verification step
- Improved environment variables

## Current Workflow Features

1. **Automated Chrome Setup**: Uses official actions for consistent installation
2. **Virtual Display**: Xvfb for headless browser operation
3. **Setup Verification**: Tests Chrome functionality before running scraper
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and troubleshooting
5. **Smart Commits**: Only commits when new data is found
6. **Detailed Reporting**: Generates summary reports for each run

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Chrome/ChromeDriver Compatibility
- **Issue**: Version mismatches between Chrome and ChromeDriver

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check NEPSE website structure changes
2. Update scraper selectors if needed
3. Monitor Chrome/ChromeDriver updates
